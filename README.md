</p>

Ensuring the safety of generative models requires rigorous and nuanced evaluation of toxic content across both text and image modalities. **ELITE** (Enhanced Language-Image Toxicity Evaluation) is a comprehensive safety evaluator and benchmark designed to address the limitations of existing safety assessments for generative models. By providing a more granular and trustworthy evaluation framework, ELITE enables a deeper understanding of model vulnerabilities and promotes the development of safer AI systems.

> **Core Mechanism:** ELITE introduces a sophisticated safety evaluator that analyzes complex language-image interactions to detect toxicity that traditional benchmarks might overlook.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Safety Benchmark:** A large-scale dataset designed to test generative models against various toxicity categories.
* **Enhanced Evaluator:** A more robust evaluation metric that aligns closely with human judgment in identifying unsafe language-image pairs.
